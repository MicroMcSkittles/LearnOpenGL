# Doom WAD Loader
This project will load in a `.wad` file and create a mesh with all the data.

You need to provide your own `.wad` file.

## What is a .wad file
`.wad` stands for "Where's All the Data", and was created by John Carmack during the production of Doom I to store all of the Doom map, entity, and texture data. 

## How does this help me learn OpenGL
The main challenge will be to generate a mesh of the level, but there are other challenges involving OpenGL, like billboarded sprites and texture loading.

## Note
This is my first project with complex binary files so the code "works" hopefully. This is the same  reason this project might not be sucessful.
